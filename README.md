One of my first attempts at making a turn based fighting game. It is working and uses a GUI. However, my code could be organized better. 
The Fighters respository is my attempt of making a turn based fighting game with cleaner code.

### How to build
Change your currect working directory to where the Makefile sits in and run the command: ```make```. You can also clean all the auto-generated files by running: ```make clean```.
